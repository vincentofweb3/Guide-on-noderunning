c is zero-knowledge (ZK) hardware startup aims to provide hardware acceleration solutions for ZK proof protocols. Cysic team developed a FPGA prototype of multi-scalar multiplication (MSM), which is an important component within ZK protocols.

-> we can contribute to cysic testnet by running a prover or verifier node.

Verifier - Most minimal requirement.
Validator - Minimal requirements [although its permissioned].
Prover - Highest requirement.
Verifier Requirements :
Mimimum Of 8GB RAM
4 Cores CPU
200GB Storage
Linux PC Or VPS && MacOS supported.
Kelpr and any EVM wallet (zerion or metamask recommended)
-> before you start create an evm wallet and export the private key to kelpr to get your evm cosmos type address.
